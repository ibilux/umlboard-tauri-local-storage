# Moving from Electron to Tauri Part 2 - Local Data Storage

TODO: write

## Building the Sample Application

To build and run the app, use the following command

```shell
npm run tdev
```

This will first build the React front end and afterwards build and run the Tauri application.

## Debugging

To debug the application, run the `Tauri Development Debug` task via the VS Code debugger. 

Debugging the front can be done via the `Front-end App Debug` task, but please note that this does currently only work under Windows.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
